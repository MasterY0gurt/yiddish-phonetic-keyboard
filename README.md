# Yiddish Phonetic Keyboard (SHWERTZ)

This is a keyboard layout targeted at a broader width of people speaking and typing in Yiddish. It is (semi-)phonetic Yiddish keyboard layout for Windows and Linux (and soon also macOS) based heavily on the german QWERTZ layout. This is due to the fact that Yiddish orthography is very similar to German orthography, resulting in a minimal amount of tweaking needed for a pleasant typing experience. 

It tries to find a compromise between the orthography of the different dialects offering the most common variations of characters in the Yiddish alphabet in addition to an easy and fast way to access the most common Niqqud and the Rafe and Dagesh markings in ways very similar to the accent keys of the German QWERTZ layout.

# To-Do:
- add macOS support
- add full Niqqud-support
